Question-1

Approach
• ​Input the values for L, R, and K using prompt().

• ​Iterate through every integer x where L <=x < R.


• ​check divisibility of x.

• ​use modulo math to ensure the digit 0 is not present.

• ​Calculate the sum of the digits of x and verify if that sum is a prime number.

• ​ display the output using alert().


Time Complexity
O((R - L)* d), where d is the number of digits in R. We iterate through the range once, and for each number, we process its digits.

Question-2

Approach

• use prompt() to take the initial number N and the student's seed.

• ​We perform a loop exactly 3 times. 

• ​If the current number is even, it is updated using the formula: (current/2)+seed.

• ​If the current number is odd, it is updated using:( current×3)-seed.

• ​Check if the final number is between 100 and 999 inclusive.

• ​Extract the middle digit of the 3-digit number and check if it equals the seed.

• ​In output Display "YES" or "NO" along with the final value using alert().

Time Complexity: 

O(1). The loop runs for a fixed number of iterations (exactly 3)
